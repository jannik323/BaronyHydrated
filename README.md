    a new Item found deep in "The Sewers"

#Install Instruction: 

This only works for the Steam version of Barony.
This mod uses a custom exe file and is thus not compatible with other mods that modify it.
Back up scores and save files, if you are worried that you will lose them.

You can find the installed Barony path, by right clicking Barony in Steam -> Properties -> Installed Files -> Browse
Then go one folder up and paste the "Barony" Folder from the "BaronyHydrated" Folder in there.

This should override the old "Barony" Folder and its subsequent subfolders and files. 
Just accept all the new file overrides and boom!

Now you should be able to play Barony Hydrated

You might have to delete the models.cache in your installed "Barony" Folder.


#Deinstall Instructions:

Just do the above but in reverse .. kinda?
Delete all changed files/ added files (compare with fresh download on BaronyHydrated)

Then right click Barony in Steam -> Properties -> Installed Files -> Verify integrity of game files

At last delete the models.cache in your installed "Barony" Folder.

If this doesnt work, then you probably missed something. Either go trough it again 
or you could just nuke the whole barony install(delete all files) and revalidate it (download it fully again)

This should not be necessary, but if you want to be safe, make a backup.
